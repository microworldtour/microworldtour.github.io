                  <p>One thing that the folks in Chicago noticed was
		  that while Mary could play music, the software as it
		  was didn't allow tunes to be played at different
		  tempos. Naomi had a look at
		  <a
		  href="https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/micropython">
		  the source code</a> and saw
		  a possible fix. After some discussion of
		  various strategies with the core developers, Naomi
		  submitted a patch that should be appearing soon!

                  <p>Mary was out for another social evening 10th
		  December as she made an appearance at the regular <a
		  href="http://www.chipy.org/" >ChiPy
		  meeting</a>. With over 60 people in attendance Mary
		  apparently got a bit of stage fright and lost her
		  interactive REPL voice. While this problem
		  made the presentation a bit more challenging, she
		  was still happy to run flashed scripts, and
		  as they say, "the show must go on!"</p>
		  <p>Naomi gave a talk about the background leading up
		  to the micro:bit, including the BBC Micro, and
		  explained some of the goals of the project and how
		  Python made it onto the micro:bit.</p>
		  <p>In spite of losing her voice, Mary did manage to
		   <a href="https://t.co/Te7x1U9WtT"> say hello to the
		  ChiPy members</a>.

                    <p>It might have taken Mary a while to make it to
		  Chicago, but she's quickly making friends!</p>
		  <p>Our first stop was a "sneak preview" evening with
		  several interested local Pythonistas. Naomi walked
		  through some of the background leading to the
		  micro:bit and having Python on it.</p>
		  <img src="/photo/Mary_with_hand.JPG" alt="Mary">
		  <p>Then, we ended with some demos and
		  experimentation. Chicago ChiPy member Tanya
		  Schlusser had brought a toy truck (a "Monster Road
		  Ripper"!) which Tanya had modified to allow control
		  from a micro:bit.</p>
                  <img src="/photo/attendees1.JPG"  alt="Chicago sneak
		  preview">
		  <p>Tanya's notes on how she took a $6.99 toy
		  and made it micro:bit-able <a href="/photo/wiring_the_road_ripper.pdf" >are here</a>. In the end it
		  was a success, since Mary managed to drive the truck
		  and even stop short of crashing!
		  </p>
		  <p>Finally we played around quite a bit with the
		  music library, even finding something that we all thought
		  needed to be "fixed". Stay tuned for a later post on
		  that.</p>
		  <p>Mary will be out for another social evening 10th
		  December as she presents at the regular <a
		  href="http://www.chipy.org/" >ChiPy
		  meeting</a>. We'll report on this in a later post.</p>
