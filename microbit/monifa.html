                    <p>Today was a programming day. I sat down and wrote the
                    code that controls both <b>micro:bot</b> and <b>micro:bob</b>.
                    The <b>micro:bob</b> is quite simple &mdash; it only has
                    a preprogrammed sequence of leg movements for walking.
                    I made a <code>Servo</code> class for convenience, and
                    then some functions for making a step with left and right
                    legs. I also added some faces. I should probably also add
                    some turning and maybe a small dance, but I was pressed for
                    time, so I left that for some other time. For now, behold,
                    <b>micro:bob</b> walking:</p>
                    <div class="video-container">
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/khRb_HOsX6c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p>The small shaking at the beginning is there to work
                    around a bug with the PWM signal. Hopefully this will get
                    fixed and won't be needed anymore.</p>
                    <p>You can also see that the robot twitches a little when
                    it's just standing still. That's another bug in the PWM.</p>
                    <p>All the code is available in the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micro-bob/src">micro:bob
                    repository</a>.</p>
                    <p>Next comes the <b>micro:bot</b>. I already had it riding
                    across my room, but now it's time to add some intelligence.
                    I started by checking how fast it goes straight and rotates,
                    so that I could use proper timing for the commands that make
                    it go a specified distance and turn a specified angle. Having
                    done that, I proceeded to calibrate the distance sensor it
                    has mounted at the front (just a simple SHARP sensor from
                    Pololu, but note that it has to run on 3V). Then I coded
                    a simple obstacle avoidance procedure: if the distance
                    sensor shows an obstacle less than about 10cm ahead, then
                    stop, turn 20° to the left, check the distance, turn back
                    and 20° the right, check distance, turn back, compare the
                    two distances and turn 60° in the direction that has more
                    free space. It works surprisingly well, as long as the
                    robot doesn't hit something that it didn't see:</p>

                    <p>The code is in the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micro-bob/src">micro:bot repository</a>.</p>
                    <p>All in all, it was quite fun to use the <b>micro:bit</b> and I hope the kids will have fun too.</p>
                    <p>As the last thing, I will try to make it control <a src="http://tote.rtfd.org">Tote</a>, a quadruped robot that I'm developing.</p>

                    <p>I didn't really have much time to properly program
                    the <b>micro:bot</b> (that's what I decided to call it), but
                    I did construct a brother for it, <b>micro:bob</b>.</p>
                    <p><img class="figure" src="../photo/IMG_20151126_134204.jpg"></p>
                    <p>This one is a walking robot based on the popular Bob
                    design. It has four servos, but two of them are connected
                    to the same signal pin, so I can control it with just the
                    three pins that are available as large pads. I didn't have
                    another small breadboard, so instead I used a servo
                    breakout board that I had lying around. A veroboard would
                    work as well. The rest is just some pieces of soft plastic
                    and a lot of hot glue.</p>
                    <p>Tomorrow I will try to program both robots to do
                    something interesting.</p>

                    <p>I received Monifa, and put it on the robot in Mahiri's
                    place. Then I tried to get the robot going, but ran into
                    some problems with the PWM signal from the <b>micro:bit</b>.</p>
                    <p>It turned out to be two separate problems. One is that
                    setting the PWM period doesn't seem to work reliably at the
                    moment. I actually went to my local hackerspace and used
                    their osciloscope to look at the signal:</p>
                    <p><img class="figure" src="../photo/IMG_20151124_203956.jpg"></p>
                    <p>Hopefully that will be fixed before it's shipped.</p>
                    <p>The other problem was powering the servos with 3V from
                    the two AAA batteries that I have used. Turns out that servos
                    rated for 4.6V don't really like that. I replaced the batteries
                    with a 3.7V LiPo battery, and now it works much better.</p>
                    <p><img class="figure" src="../photo/IMG_20151125_105637s.jpg"></p>
                    <p>I also figured out how to append the Python script at the end
                    of the hex file with the firmware. Turns out that after you run
                    it through the "hexlify.py" script and append at the end, you
                    still need to find and move the "end of file" line, which looks like this:</p>
                    <pre>:00000001FF</pre>
                    <p>Then just drag-and-drop the file into <b>micro:bit</b>, and the robot
                    can go on its own:</p>

                    <div class="video-container">
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iVpkl9NlzB0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p>Now I just need to make it use that sensor (and maybe the compass too?).</p>
                    <p>By the way, I also got an edge connector, to get to all the other pins on this board. After some assembly, it looks like this:</p>
                    <p><img class="figure" src="../photo/IMG_20151124_154459.jpg"></p>
                    <p>I like how they added the three rows of pins at the
                    bottom, for easily connecting your own stuff. But I hate
                    that they got the order of the two power rows wrong. It
                    should be ground-power-signal, from the top, not
                    power-ground-signal. This way you cannot connect RC hobby
                    servos to this or other common sensors (ground-power-signal
                    is a kind of a standard). Oh well.</p>
