        <h1>What?</h1>

        <p>The
        <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/microbit">BBC's micro:bit</a>
        is a small computing device for children. Thanks to
        <a href="http://ntoll.org/article/story-micropython-on-microbit">some amazing work</a>
        by Damien George, the creator of
        <a href="http://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a>, there is a full
        re-implementation of Python 3 that runs on the device.</p>

        <p><strong>We have five of these devices to share with the world-wide
        Python community.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>We want code to be created, videos to be shot and articles
        to be written.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>This "world-tour" is a cheap-and-cheerful way to make this
        work.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>This website will log each of the five devices' journeys.</strong></p>

        <h1>How?</h1>

        <p>We will post 5 micro:bits to 5 people we know.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>They have a week to learn about the device and produce
            something fun. Their task is to surprise, delight and educate
            us!</li>
            <li>After a week they create a pull request to
            <a href="https://github.com/microworldtour/microworldtour.github.io">our code repository</a>
            detailing what they've done:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzCYc445IVNQimtxAlPpaFMtvv8qKSncK">point to videos</a>,
            <a href="http://ntoll.org/article/story-micropython-on-microbit">link to blog posts</a>
            or tell us about a
            <a href="https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/micropython/milestones">new feature</a>.</li>
            <li>They post the device to a new person who repeats the
            process.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you want to get involved <em>read the README in
        <a href="https://github.com/microworldtour/microworldtour.github.io">our code repository</a></em>
        for more information. :-)</p>

        <p>Hopefully, in a relatively short period of time, we'll have spread
        the word about this remarkable device and generated a significant
        number of projects, resources and features that children can use.</p>

        <h1>Who?</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>If you're from a background which isn't well-represented in
            most geeky groups, get involved - <strong>we want to help you make
            a difference</strong>.</li>
            <li>If you're from a background which is well-represented in most
            geeky groups, get involved - <strong>we want your help making a
            difference</strong>.</li>
            <li>If you're worried about not being technical enough, get
            involved - <strong>your fresh perspective will be
            invaluable</strong>.</li>
            <li>If you think you're an imposter, get involved.</li>
            <li>If your day job isn't code, get involved.</li>
            <li>This isn't a group of experts, just people.</li>
            <li>We are interested in the educational, social and technical
            problems.</li>
            <li>This is a new community. <strong>No-one knows what they are
            doing</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>(The list above was adapted from
        <a href="http://computeranonymous.org/">here</a>.)</p>

        <p>"What children will be using the device?" I hear you ask.</p>

        <p>A million micro:bits will be given out to all the UK's children in
        academic year 7 (11 to 12 year olds). When this happens all
        the digital assets needed to create the device as well as all the
        software needed to program it will be released under an open-source
        license. Put simply, anyone, anywhere in the world will be able to fork
        the project and make it their own. You'll also be able to buy such
        devices via mail-order from the UK soon after they are given to the
        children in the spring of 2016.</p>

        <p>The following video of an early version of MicroPython running on
        the device will give you a flavour of the sort of things you can
        do.</p>
